This project is one based off of the pythagoream theorem, using Bhasakara's method to prove this theorem by rearranging the triangles to form a square. I used the python module of Manim to animate this animation and prove this theorem, connecting this theory (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) into a real-life, technological animation and model that further proves its existence and capabilities. I used the Jupyter Notebook in this project to improve the efficiency and neatness of my code, as well as create a step by step walkthrough of my program. Furthermore, comments are used to walk the user through the process of moving and creating the triangles. Hope you enjoy the project!
